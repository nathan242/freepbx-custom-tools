# FreePBX Custom Tools

My custom FreePBX management tools. Put those in a subfolder on your FreePBX webroot.

Features:

* TFTP Manager - Create and edit per MAC address TFTP configuration files for Cisco 7940 phones (and possibly other models).
* Extension List - Simple extension list viewer and exporter.
* Extension Config - Shows all extensions and lists the queues and ring groups that they are a member of.
* Inbound Routes - Shows visually the routes taken by inbound phone numbers.
